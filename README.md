# ask-alexa-pykit
Super simple Python starter code for developing apps for the Amazon Echo's  SDK - ASK:  Alexa Skills Kit.
Check the scripts in the scripts folder for utility code on how to get started with building the config files used by the ASK.
Run ./install.sh to download the python dependencies needed for this project. Currently the install.sh script is designed for a Ubuntu style Linux platform, but take a look inside, porting it over to Mac or Windows should be pretty trivial if you have python installed. 

Detailed instructions coming soon.
